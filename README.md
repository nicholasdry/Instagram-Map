# Instagram-Map
Project made to mimic the function of the old Instagram map feature.

So far it only scrapes the last 12 pictures you posted. Will be expanded to handle all images posted by the user. 

Scrapes for location names and the uses the Google Maps API to get the latitiude and longitude. Did this to learn how to access and scrape Google's APIs.

` python3 map.py -user INSERT_USER `
